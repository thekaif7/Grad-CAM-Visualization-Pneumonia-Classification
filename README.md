# Grad-CAM-Visualization-Pneumonia-Classification
Explainable visualization of convolutional neural network using – Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM).

Grad-CAM is ‘visual explanations’ for decisions from a large class of Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more
transparent and explainable.

Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
(Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say
‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words
in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional
layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the
important regions in the image for predicting the concept.
